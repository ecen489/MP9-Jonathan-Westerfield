# MP9-Jonathan-Westerfield
MP9 Tensorflow and text recognition.

For Part 2, the tensorflow part, I just used the example code and modified it a little bit.
 I realized that my implementation of the
camera was compressing my image outputs too much and it would be impossible to classify the images correctly. I decided to just take
the codelab code and modify it to make the UI what the instructions needed, since the codelab code already had the camera
implementation at the highest quality.

If you run the code, you'll see that the layout was modified to contain a caputer button 
and a listview to display the statistics.
